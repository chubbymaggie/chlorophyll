TODO
- place(y) in parallel map still doesn't work
  => run visitor-placetype after unroll?
- test fixpint for assign, binexp, uexp, if, while, function, array of pair

- conversion
- digital functions?
- cprinter >> signed shift right

- rethink key for cache (no mem-size, etc.)
- other optimizations: dce, instr fetch, first order funcs
- no need to use lock in cache.rkt
- why compiling md5 is so slow

FASTER PARTITIONER
- infer each function first (see issue about racket)

ISSUE ABOUT RACKET
- incremental solving not working
- branch debug

MEMO
- same VarDecl => same sym-place!!!

BENCHMARKS
* faster sqrt
- matrix multiply
- insertion sort
- mergesort (function, recursion)
- disparity
- transpose
- DP (activity scheduling)
- fibonacci 
- shortest path
- MST
- DFS, BFS
- heap
- blackscholes (float, log, exp)
- FFT
