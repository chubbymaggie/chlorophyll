TODO
0) test-simulate
1) ssd & swap: same layout noopt vs opt
2) md1-opt, md3 runtime
3) MSP, snapdragon?
4) more benchmarks with new unroll synth

benchmarks: ssd_simple, ssd_small, bit hack

- measure time & energy
- more benchmarks
  = vs expert
  = vs unopt
  = vs manual code
- call rohin's compiler to get program size
  = if size > 64 words -> define-repeating-code for shorter seq
- connect to rohin's interpreter
  = left, right, up, down
  = 0 , 0 , 0 ,
- or tikhon's
  = word for starting to execute
- stat report

- redundant temp for funccall
- kill z3 when user break happens
- nop is less than everything, @ < @+
- 3 a! @ 32 - 1 . + . + 0 . + a! @
  = implement an abstract interpreter to just figure how many send and recv we need
  = no need to generate first pair from the interpreter

- reset rosette when solving new problem (see compiler.rkt)
- known type interpreter
  = for-array2-error.cll should have compile error: other variable (e.g. i) can't be at the same place ast clustered array
- data type check (x[i] + y) when y is array
- visitor-divider can't handle nested indexes (eg. +@place(x[i*n+j]))

- refactoring interpretor & flow & comminsert
- topological sort
- recursion
- general for?
- for-array-fancy.cll
- do we have to support int@any x?
  might need one more pass to get inferred place (e.g. @any)

FASTER PARTITIONER
- infer each function first (see issue about racket)
- incremental solving on num-msg

ISSUE ABOUT RACKET
- branch debug
- email emina about smaller example
- after the error is gone, do perf test again (partial vs no partial)

BETTER ESTIMATION
- symbolic set or lower space to 4
  vector v of set s
  (vector-ref v i) -> (ite cond (set *) (set * /))
  (set-add (vector-ref v i) %) => ERROR

MEMO
- same VarDecl => same sym-place!!!

BENCHMARKS
- md5

- matrix multiply
- insertion sort
- SSD
- transpose

- DP (activity scheduling)
- fibonacci 

- shortest path
- MST
- DFS, BFS
- heap

- bit hack benchmarks

RUN
- 1D convolution (better analysis)
- prefixsum (better analysis)
- ssd (multiple copies) in laptop?

future
- blackscholes (float, log, exp)
- mergesort (function, recursion)
- FFT
