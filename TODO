TODO
- prohibit rep with push and pop
- regalloc is not doing the right thing.
  1) can't use rstack, use dstack instead
  2) only some variables are valid to store in dstack
- md5: after more accurate flow graph, after more opt
- kill z3

- runtime & energy: ssd, swap, md4
- more benchmarks: disparity, integer square root, fibonacci, hearing aid

- measure time & energy
- more benchmarks

- call rohin's compiler to get program size
  = if size > 64 words -> define-repeating-code for shorter seq
- connect to rohin's interpreter
  = left, right, up, down

- stat report

- redundant temp for funccall
- kill z3 when user break happens
- nop is less than everything, @ < @+

  = implement an abstract interpreter to just figure how many send and recv we need
  = no need to generate first pair from the interpreter

- reset rosette when solving new problem (see compiler.rkt)
- known type interpreter
  = for-array2-error.cll should have compile error: other variable (e.g. i) can't be at the same place ast clustered array
- data type check (x[i] + y) when y is array
- visitor-divider can't handle nested indexes (eg. +@place(x[i*n+j]))

- refactoring interpretor & flow & comminsert
- topological sort
- recursion
- general for?
- for-array-fancy.cll
- do we have to support int@any x?
  might need one more pass to get inferred place (e.g. @any)

FASTER PARTITIONER
- infer each function first (see issue about racket)
- incremental solving on num-msg

ISSUE ABOUT RACKET
- branch debug
- email emina about smaller example
- after the error is gone, do perf test again (partial vs no partial)

BETTER ESTIMATION
- symbolic set or lower space to 4
  vector v of set s
  (vector-ref v i) -> (ite cond (set *) (set * /))
  (set-add (vector-ref v i) %) => ERROR

MEMO
- same VarDecl => same sym-place!!!

BENCHMARKS
- md5

- matrix multiply
- insertion sort
- SSD
- transpose

- DP (activity scheduling)
- fibonacci 

- shortest path
- MST
- DFS, BFS
- heap

- bit hack benchmarks

RUN
- 1D convolution (better analysis)
- prefixsum (better analysis)
- ssd (multiple copies) in laptop?

future
- blackscholes (float, log, exp)
- mergesort (function, recursion)
- FFT
