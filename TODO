TODO
- tempdecl's place has to connnect with funccall
- inline
- clustered array and function
- optimize MD5 more
- reuse memory space (variables of different loops that are not on stack at the same time)

REORGANIZATION
- merge example and tests/run
- generate code of examples/simple/sqrt.cll in examples/simple/sqrt/

MISC
- data type check (x[i] + y) when y is array
- visitor-divider can't handle nested indexes (eg. +@place(x[i*n+j]))
- test for-array-fancy.cll

FASTER PARTITIONER
- infer each function first (see issue about racket)
* iterative feedback for MD5
  = call rohin's compiler to get program size
    + if size > 64 words -> define-repeating-code for shorter seq
  = connect to rohin's interpreter
    + left, right, up, down
    + 0 , 0 , 0 ,

ISSUE ABOUT RACKET
- incremental solving not working
- branch debug

MEMO
- same VarDecl => same sym-place!!!

BENCHMARKS
* faster sqrt
- matrix multiply
- insertion sort
- mergesort (function, recursion)
- disparity
- transpose
- DP (activity scheduling)
- fibonacci 
- shortest path
- MST
- DFS, BFS
- heap
- blackscholes (float, log, exp)
- FFT
