 --> less accuracy version (skip 13 accelerometer readings before processing a new one)

accelerometer-opt.aforth
  --> read from accelermoter at ~200Hz
accelerometer-power-meas.aforth
  --> measure the power consumption of accelerometer reading
guesture-recognition-opt.aforth
  --> complete guesture recognition application
guesture-recognition-msp430-sim.aforth
  --> measure classifcation accuracy on the msp430
processing-power-meas.aforth
  --> measure power consumption for processing the acceleromter readings
