; TODO: Creating the actual layout map.  See main.rkt.

; Note:  Need to check on how equality of symbolic variables works.
; If there are two different symbolic variables a and b representing
; two different physical cores, but then the solver decides to set
; them to the same physical core, what will (= a b) do?  Might it be
; better to use (equal? a b) ?  (This is important for determining the
; estimated size of a core.)
